## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Compressed 10 research-suggested phases into 5 for quick depth -- grouped by dependency chains (security/errors -> thread safety/validation -> cache/recovery -> enhancements -> testing)
- [Roadmap]: Testing consolidated into final phase rather than distributed -- all features must exist before comprehensive validation
